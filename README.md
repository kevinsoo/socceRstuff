<b>Scraping, cleaning and visualizing soccer data</b>

I've scraped and cleaned the Premier League 2015-2016 standard and control statistics. The file <i>kevin_scrapeData.R</i> does this.

I recommend just starting with the complete .Rda file. To load data:
```R
load("AllData_PremLeague1516.Rda")
```
